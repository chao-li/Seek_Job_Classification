Objective:
1. What variable is the best predictor for salary?
2. What variables can classify job titles?

Note: 
- Data related jobs
- Limit search to a single region
- Scrap from indeed.com


Question 1:
- Regression problem
Consider:
- NLP
- PCA
- Clustering
- Ensemble method, try bagging, write my own vote-average

BONUS PROBLEM
Your boss would rather tell a client incorrectly that they would get a lower salary job than tell a client incorrectly that they would get a high salary job. Adjust one of your models to ease his mind, and explain what it is doing and any tradeoffs. Plot the ROC curve.

Question 2:
- Classification problem
Consider:
- What components of a job posting distinguish data scientists from other data jobs?
- What features are important for distinguishing junior vs. senior positions?
- Do the requirements for titles vary significantly with industry (e.g. healthcare vs. government)?


Convert your executive summary into a public blog post of at least 500 words, in which you document your approach in a tutorial for other aspiring data scientists. Link to this in your notebook.

          pride in what you create, yet are not too precious about your code when it needs to evolve. Our business moves fast and moves often, so we all have to be nimble.   You will need to have: At least 5 years experience developing class-leading predictive, clustering and/or classification models in commercial environments. A good understanding of the various ways that data can be analysed and the algorithms that exist for each of those ways. Proven commercial experience in statistical and machine learning modelling, with experience manipulating and ‘making sense’ of big data from disparate systems. Advanced skills in analytical programming: SQL, R and/or Python. Experience with SAP in general, and Hana in particular. Experience in working in complex, multi-stakeholder environments.

We have two products we’re pretty proud of – Q Research Software, the most advanced analysis tool designed for market researchers and Displayr, a revolutionary online data science, visualization and reporting platform.   We are a rapidly growing start-up. But don’t stress - unlike most start-ups that are 'rapidly growing', Displayr is built on the rock-solid foundation of our awesome products. The sales of Q and Displayr fund our (competitive) salaries, our (fun) team lunches and even more importantly - allows us to keep growing safely. Our team of creative and hard-working employees has grown from 12 to 42 in the last three years. About the job: Here is the chance to shape the test automation in a fast-growing agile, devops focused company, surrounded by smart people. This is a key role which has the opportunity to define, build and lead a test automation team as we grow (if team lead is of interest to you). We need someone with senior test automation experience to: About you: The successful applicant will have the following: Desirable: Why work at Displayr: Unlike at other companies, you won’t just be a cog in the machine. Every day you’ll be able to see the decisions you make have a tangible impact. You’ll be helping people who never dreamed they ‘could do’ data science. But that’s not all. Along with a healthy compensation package (up to $140K depending on experience etc.) we also offer share options in the business. While Displayr grows, you’ll grow too. While we work hard and always push for awesome, our workplace culture is pretty relaxed. We enjoy flexible work hours (before/after core hours of 10.30-5pm) and weekly team lunches. Our chic converted warehouse head office in Glebe, Sydney is joined by offices in London, UK and Chicago, US. And we’re just getting started. (Note, Displayr is entirely self-funded and was started in 2003 – our funding won’t dry up.) So, nice job! You’ve already picked the right start up. We believe that a workplace that welcomes a variety of perspectives, experiences and backgrounds is important and will only push us to be better. We never discriminate on the basis of gender, age, ethnic background, disability status, religion, or sexual orientation."

          analytics for predicting user cognition and health status, human-robot interaction, brain-computer and adaptive interfaces, education and health interfaces and related topics in human-centred interfaces. The focus of your role will include research on predicting user cognition and/or health status based on analysis of different modalities (such as speech, writing, physical activity patterns, gaze, bio-sensors, etc.) during naturally occurring
          activities. These analyses will involve exploring predictive patterns at the signal, activity pattern, lexical, and/or transactional levels. The preferred candidate would be an energetic and innovative researcher with a strong publication record who is interested in pioneering in emerging research areas. The candidate should have completed a PhD in computer science, engineering,
          information sciences, cognitive or linguistic sciences, and have a deep interest in developing new technologies to identify and facilitate users’ cognitive and health status. The candidate ideally would have completed 2-4 years of postdoctoral

When John Monash Science School opened its doors to its first students in Term One 2010, it became Victoria’s first specialist secondary school devoted to these fields of endeavour.  The vision for John Monash Science School is to be a nationally and internationally recognised centre for excellence in innovative research-based teaching and learning in the later years of secondary science, mathematics, associated technologies, resource development and pedagogy.  The school will contribute to Victoria’s, and the Nation’s, long term economic, social, cultural and environmental goals through delivery of high quality and innovative education in science, mathematics and technologies. The John Monash Science School will: (a)            engage students through innovation in a relevant and integrated curriculum and investigation- based learning approaches; (b)            provide pathways into senior secondary and university studies for high achievers pursuing Science and Mathematics; (c)            develop high quality effective teaching strategies to be shared amongst teachers throughout the state; and (d)            provide ongoing up-to-date knowledge in rapidly advancing areas of science. Students with a keen interest in science and mathematics will have the opportunity to learn in an environment that both nurtures and challenges their special interests, with access to the resources of Monash University. Monash University has committed significant resources and has dedicated staff in both the Faculties of Education and Science to support the students and staff of the John Monash Science School. Students enrolled in the school will receive additional curriculum and academic services supported by nationally recognised academic staff in all disciplines of the Sciences and Education. This means that the John Monash Science School is able to offer an enviable education unequalled elsewhere. Working with like-minded peers, expert teachers, and taking advantage of world-class facilities, students at John Monash Science School will be encouraged to perform to the highest academic level in order to achieve their goals. Goals of the school The goals of the John Monash Science School are to: ·       develop and foster a passionate curiosity of science and mathematics in students; ·       challenge students to develop deep understanding through engagement with ideas and evidence; ·       link student learning with business, industry and research sectors of the community; ·       personalise student learning; ·       use assessment for making informed and consistent judgements to improve future student learning by ongoing gathering, analysing and reflecting on evidence; ·       foster high levels of student achievement; ·       provide opportunities for all students to meet the requirements of the VELS, complete a VCE and obtain an ATAR score to support applications for entry into courses in tertiary education; ·       stimulate and support ongoing teacher learning and collaborative teacher research within the school; ·       develop and improve the quality of teaching practices of pre-service teachers; ·       develop innovative curriculum and teaching resources and practices that are shared across Victorian secondary schools; and ·       promote and provide credentialed professional learning for teachers in Victoria and elsewhere. Learning Environment and Curriculum At John Monash Science School the focus will be on providing students not only with an education of the highest academic standard, but one which also encourages independent, creative thinking. Students will be individually assessed in order for an individual learning plan to be developed for each student. Each student’s progress against their learning plans and goals will then be monitored.  A key aspect for success in the study of science is a sound basis in the ‘enabling’ subjects of chemistry, physics and mathematics. The sound teaching in the theory and application of these subjects will be key foci of the curriculum and a solid understanding of these fundamental areas is ensured for each student. The school will utilise inquiry-based learning as one aspect of the delivery of the curriculum Some of the documented benefits of this style of learning are that it: These are skills that are essential to develop in the study of science and mathematics and this will essentially give students at the John Monash Science School an advantage for any further studies they choose to undertake. The opportunity for students to see the latest application of scientific developments in the University will be incorporated into the curriculum to enrich the students’ experiences in science and mathematics. The school is located in the STRIP (Science and Technology, Research and Innovation Precinct’) of the University, which includes numerous University-affiliated research organisations. The Australian Synchrotron and the largest Victorian operation of the CSIRO are also located at the Clayton campus. The comprehensive curriculum satisfies all Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) requirements, while the focus on mathematics, technology and science-based subjects allows students to benefit from specialised learning opportunities. Applicants are advised to visit our website www.jmss.vic.edu.au for further information about the school. Selection Criteria
 KSC1: Demonstrated high level organisational, time management and planning skills. KSC2: Demonstrated capacity to communicate effectively with a range of personnel including the ability to work effectively in a team in the organising and prioritising of work, together with excellent communication and interpersonal skills when relating to students, parents, colleagues and partner organisations ie: Monash University, KSC3: Demonstrated capacity to build networks of people and organisations to assist a school or similar organisation and sustain strong working relationships with them. KSC4: Demonstrated ability to establish and grow an exceptional library information system which allows students and teachers to access high quality resources to support their learning and research, KSC5: Demonstrated high-order skills in the use of modern digital technologies as appropriate to complete the work. Role
 Range 3 is distinguished by the introduction of management responsibility and accountability for the delivery of professional support services. The role will usually impact beyond the work area or professional field. It seeks to gain cooperation of other staff members or members of the school community to achieve specific objectives, such as in school administration, operations or educational programs. Direction on targets and goals is provided but the position will have some degree of latitude in determining how they are achieved. This latitude will generally be limited by standard procedures and school policy.  Deviation from standard procedures and school policy will require guidance and direction from senior management. The provision of business management responsibilities becomes a feature at range 3.  Coordination of staff to achieve the expected outcomes is a key responsibility.  Staff management issues will be resolved with minimal reference to senior management, although guidance will be required in more complex cases.  Senior management will be provided with timely reports and advice, although this will generally be confined to matters relating to the immediate work area, service provision or educational program and is unlikely to impact substantially on whole of school operations. This is the minimum range for positions that carry a mandatory qualification requirement of not less than four years.  Professional student support positions become a feature at range 3 (e.g. therapists, psychologists) where standard professional services are delivered.  Professional support and guidance will be close at hand and deviation from standard procedures and school policy will require guidance and direction from senior management. An education support class position supports the educational services being provided to students, but must not include duties of teaching as defined in clause 2.6.1 of the Education and Training Reform Act 2006 (Vic) or its successor.  Supervision of students cannot be required except where it is an integral part of the employee's position or involves supervision of students individually or in small groups, in controlled circumstances, where the responsibility for students remains clearly with a teacher. This position is a 48/52 position. A full-time employee is entitled to 152 hours (20 days) annual leave and  228 hours (30 days) additional paid leave in respect of each calendar year.  Part-time employees receive annual leave entitlements on a pro rata basis calculated according to the time fraction worked. Education support class employees are expected to use annual leave and additional paid leave during school vacation periods unless otherwise approved.  Public holidays that fall during a period of additional paid leave are not regarded as part of that leave. This position does not normally require attendance during school term breaks, any change to this will be negotiated with the successfull applicant. Responsibilities

Its distinct intellectual capacity is reflected in 95% of its research output being ranked above world standard. This research excellence
          contributes to the social, economic and human capital of the nation. The ANU is located in Canberra, Australia’s capital and is a partner to the Australian government and a resource for its people. Canberra was evaluated in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
          Regional Well-Being Report 2014 as the most liveable city in the world. The ANU College of Engineering and Computer Science (CECS) is dedicated to contributing to The Australian National University’s reputation for excellence in research and research-led education, bringing together expertise across a range of areas
          to reimagine the role of engineering and computing for future generations. CECS is a diverse and vibrant community dedicated to discovery and to making knowledge matter. Our academics and students are engaged in ground-breaking, cutting-edge
          research, in exciting areas such as renewable energy, robotics, telecommunications, biomaterials, human-machine interaction, and artificial intelligence. One of the reasons ANU stands apart from other universities is its ability to look beyond the day to day and address some of the biggest problems facing the world. The ANU Grand Challenge Scheme is a program that calls on researchers to identify
          a problem or challenge that is of world impact and national relevance. What is unique about the program is the way it seeks to bring people together from all across the University, to bring new perspectives to a major challenge confronting society. The winner of the first round of this scheme, announced in November 2017, is the project titled ‘Our Health in Our Hands: Future Personalised Medical Technologies for Sustainable and Effective Healthcare’ (OHIOH). This project aims to
          revolutionise personalised medicine by providing new means for non-invasive collection and analysis of health data including the development of miniaturised sensors for detection of biomarkers in multiple sclerosis (MS) and diabetes. Multiple positions are available at the Academic Level B/C for a fixed term for a period of up to three (3) years to contribute to software engineering and databases related to machine learning (ML) and cybersecurity as keys to unlock big multi-modal
          time-series data. The overall purpose is to develop future technologies for objectively revealing early indicators of MS and diabetes, their progression, and their prognosis over time whilst ensuring healthcare patients and professionals’ right
          for privacy. If modelled correctly as features in ML, data collected from smartphones and new sensors holds the potential for early detection and regular monitoring of disease in an affordable, scalable, noninvasive, patient-friendly manner
          in the comfort of the patient’s own home. However, real-life privacy-sensitive data are a prerequisite for conducting the proposed project, and consequently, storing and using confidential data requires careful consideration and compliance with
          legal and ethical principles and standards related to healthcare devices, personal data, health records, and data processing systems.  Applications are particularly invited from researchers whose interests are synergistic with existing research groups within the RSCS and whose breadth of vision reaches across traditional discipline silos. We welcome and develop diversity of backgrounds,
          experiences and ideas and encourage applications from individuals who may have had non-traditional career paths, who may have taken a career break or who have achieved excellence in careers outside of academia.
